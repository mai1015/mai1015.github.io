Bit torrent is currently pretty popular way to download, beside this, there is PT as well.

advantage using bit torrent:

- It is using peer-to-peer networking to do the file serving.
- It contains the file information that checks if the file is corrupted.
- It encourage people to upload their file, then people can download faster and share the portion that other client doesn't have.
- Torrent is open-sourced.

there will be a tracking server that keep tracks all the people who downloaded the file, and they can make file download faster when peer work together.
